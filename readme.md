Import components to Figma by dragging them and dropping in your editor.

Their HTML markup will be automatically converted to Figma element format.

> Due to the project being in beta, there could still be many issues with the accuracy of conversion.

> Please, report any problems regarding that matter

Storybook To Figma can generate variants by combining props of your story!

Use toggles in dedicated addon panel to check what props you want to combine.

Individual variants can also be dragged - just as single, non-combined components
